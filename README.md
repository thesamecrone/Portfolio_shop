# Portfolio Shop Projects

This repository contains my personal projects, showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.

All projects are fully responsive, structured, and include real JS logic such as sorting, filtering, carousels, search functionality, and form validation. GitHub is active daily, with commits showing continuous development and systematic approach.

## Projects

1. [Agriculture Portfolio](./portfolio/README.md) – Multi-page responsive site with interactive features: scroll-to-top button, product sorting (price ascending/descending and range), search, and callback form.
2. [BikeShop](./bikeshop/README.md) – E-commerce frontend with product catalog, carousels, dynamic variants, filters, and Node.js/Express backend for authentication and data handling (in progress).
